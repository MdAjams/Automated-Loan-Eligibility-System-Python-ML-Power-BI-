## 🧠 Model Building

Steps followed in `notebooks/Real-Time Loan Eligibility Prediction.ipynb`:

- Baseline model using **Logistic Regression** (with class weights)
- Tree-based models: **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**
- Hyperparameter tuning with **GridSearchCV**
- Final model selection based on **F1 Score**

🏆 **Final Model**: `RandomForestClassifier`  
💾 Saved as: `models/loan_eligibility.pkl`

## 🚀 Prediction

`loan_predict.py` is a script to load `test.csv` and generate predictions.

### Usage:

bash
python loan_predict.py

### 📦 Requirements
Install dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


### ✅ Key Findings
- Credit_History is the most important feature.
- High ApplicantIncome to LoanAmount ratio improves chances.
- Married graduates from semi-urban areas had higher approval rates.
- Final model achieved 80%+ accuracy on validation set.

### 💡 Recommendations
- Auto-approve applicants with strong credit history and good income-to-loan ratios.
- Use model confidence scores for risk-based decision making.
- Retrain model periodically with new data to improve performance.
