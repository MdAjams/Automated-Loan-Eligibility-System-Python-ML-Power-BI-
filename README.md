# Real-Time-Loan-Eligibility-Prediction
Dream Housing Finance is a growing company that provides home loans across India. Currently, the loan approval process is manual, time-consuming, and inconsistent. This project aims to build a predictive model that can automatically assess whether a customer is eligible for a loan based on historical application data.
