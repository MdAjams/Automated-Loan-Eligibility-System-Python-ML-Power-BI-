## 🧠 Model Building

Steps followed in `notebooks/Real-Time Loan Eligibility Prediction.ipynb`:

## 🧠 Model Building

In this project, we built a loan eligibility prediction model using Python libraries like **pandas**, **numpy**, and **scikit-learn**.

### Steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Loaded the training and test datasets using `pandas`.  
   - Converted categorical variables into numbers using `LabelEncoder` for easy processing by the model.

2. **Model Training**  
   - Used the **Random Forest Classifier** from `sklearn.ensemble` to train the model on the processed training data.  
   - Suppressed warnings with Python's `warnings` module to keep the output clean.

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated model accuracy on the training set using `accuracy_score` from `sklearn.metrics`.

4. **Model Saving**  
   - The trained model is saved for future predictions.

This approach ensures the model can accurately predict loan eligibility based on applicant details, making loan approvals faster and more consistent.

🏆 **Final Model**: `RandomForestClassifier`  
💾 Saved as: `Models/loan_eligibility.pkl`

## 🚀 Prediction

`loan_predict.py` is a script to load `test.csv` and generate predictions.

### Usage:

bash
`Real-Time Loan Eligibility Prediction.ipynb`

### 📦 Requirements
Install dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


### ✅ Key Findings
- Credit_History is the most important feature.
- High ApplicantIncome to LoanAmount ratio improves chances.
- Married graduates from semi-urban areas had higher approval rates.
- Final model achieved 80%+ accuracy on validation set.

### 💡 Recommendations
- Auto-approve applicants with strong credit history and good income-to-loan ratios.
- Use model confidence scores for risk-based decision making.
- Retrain model periodically with new data to improve performance.
